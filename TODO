Validate variable name prefixes as they're passed to functions.

Initialize new installation with carton_init

Use single quotes around assertions in non-evaled code everywhere.

Put actual simple descriptions at the start of modules instead of just object
names.

Consider naming object "strings" "handles" or something similar instead.

Put only unchangeable, identification data in the "handles".

Consider not accessing "handle" contents directly outside the module, but
using accessor functions instead.

Consider reversing the meaning: make "handles" be "objects" themselves and
name whatever they unpack to specifically.

Verify variable type in carton_arr_parse/print

Add commit hash to revision identifier so that revisions with the same number
from different merged branches do not conflict.

Switch to using ep_test_sh/ep_suite_sh, where appropriate.

Consider doing assertions between argument assignment and initial macros.
