Validate variable name prefixes as they're passed to functions.

Initialize new installation with carton_init

Use single quotes around assertions in non-evaled code everywhere.

Put actual simple descriptions at the start of modules instead of just object
names.

Consider naming object "strings" "handles" or something similar instead.

Put only unchangeable, identification data in the "handles".

Consider not accessing "handle" contents directly outside the module, but
using accessor functions instead.

Consider reversing the meaning: make "handles" be "objects" themselves and
name whatever they unpack to specifically.

Switch to using ep_test_sh/ep_suite_sh, where appropriate.

Consider doing assertions between argument assignment and initial macros.

Revert backtrace order, so the assertion failure message is next to the
function it occured in.

Rename rpmbuild macro "rev" to "carton_dot_rev" and add "carton_rev" macro,
one without a dot at the start, to be used with packages not interested in
RPM-specific numbers yet. The package can switch from "carton_rev" to
"carton_dot_rev" later.

Do channel list publishing and withdrawing via repo list, move repo hooks to
repo list.
